vagrant-elasticsearch-ansible
=============================

DevOps demonstration for provisioning a Vagrant VM with elasticsearch and kibana.  This will allow you to 
be able to start transmitting data to elasticsearch with minimal setup time.

Required software
=============================

Vagrant: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Oracle JDK: https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+jdk

  You could use openjdk, but from the elasticsearch workshop I attended, the core dev's recommended Oracle.
  I won't be able to include this in the git repo due to the Oracle license but I'll make a marker for it.
  
Ansible: https://github.com/ansible/ansible

Setup
======
