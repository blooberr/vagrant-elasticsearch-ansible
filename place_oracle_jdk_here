Download link is here and may change: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Download file should like jdk-7u40-linux-x64.gz, depending on what you're using to unzip 
or install the jdk.

If all else fails, try: https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+jdk

Leave jdk-7u40-linux-x64.gz in this directory.  The provisioning script will use it from there.
